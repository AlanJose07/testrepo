version:
  "1.3"
info:
  description: This widget displays an Oracle Policy Automation interview on a page using JSON transactions to complete the interview, unless the deployment uses August 2016 styling, which will host the interview within an iframe. The widget relies on built-in config verbs OPA_APP_BASE_URL and OPA_APP_SECRET.   --CHANGES since widget version 1.2-- an iframe is no longer used for deployments using Latest Version styling, Web Determinations is responsible for determining if there is an available Checkpoint, and the text on the Checkpoint Options screen is configured by the policy model, not by the page inserting the widget.
